This repo includes an interactive tool for exploring the linear free energy relationship of reaction performed in optical microcavities. Simply input the permanent dipole moments from Orca SCF calculations and the absorption spectrum from Orca TDDFT calculations for the reactant, transition state, and product of a reaction of your choice to explore its kinetics and thermodynamics in a cavity.
